# Goals

As a first-year student at the University of Missouri, I have a long college career ahead. Given that it will go by extremely fast, I need to set both _long term_ and _short term_ goals as soon as possible. One of which is 'coded' below.

console.log(var)

## The Short Stuff

Since "short" and "long" is relative, this list is going to extend to the end of my college career, so about 4 or 5 years. Anything after will be classified under "long".

* Graduate with a Major in [Information Technology](http://catalog.missouri.edu/undergraduategraduate/collegeofengineering/informationtechnology/bs-information-technology/) with a minor in [Computer Science](https://engineering.missouri.edu/academics/engineering-minors/minor-computer-science/) and [English](https://english.missouri.edu/undergrad/english-minor)

  * This can always change, but the **English** minor would set me apart

* Secure an Internship the _summer_ after my **Sohomore** and **Junior** year

  * Ideally, after my Junior year I would be able to work for the company I am interning

* Get involved in the 3D-Printing Organization and the MUVR Organization on campus

  * I have a hard time trying to organize my time to make room for these clubs.

* Become an active member of a [volunteer organization](https://muserves.missouri.edu/volunteer) 

* Help others with papers and other schoolwork

## Looking Ahead (Long Term)

Looking onto after college, I of course want a job. Though there are also so many other goals that I have other than just getting a decent job.

* Pay off any and all school debts

  * Though **_ALL_** debts in general

* Become "comfortable" in life

  * NO Debts
  * Pay myself first
  * Decent savings

* Look for somebody to live with (possibly)

  * The cheesy Disney  movie plot of wanting somebody to marry. However if I am happier alone I will live alone.

* Serve

  * Serve friends, family, the world

* Create a [technology](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/08/here-s-how-technology-can-help-us-save-the-planet/) that will help a certain group of people/earth

  * Helping the earth has always been my number one priority, I hope to create or help take part of something bigger than me.
