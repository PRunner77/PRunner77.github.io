# Running Throughout the Years

>## "Runners to your mark"

*Heart Pounding*

>## "Set"

*"Why do I run"*

>## *BAM*

Every single race thoughout my 8 years of running went exactly like this. Whether the race be in **Track**, **Cross Country**, or **just for fun**, I still get the pre-race jitters as the announcer starts the race. However, I still run and still enjoy the *adrenaline* I get throughout the race.

### Middle School

Back in middle school, my [running career](https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=8044505) started out as a sprinter. Looking back, I wasn't the worst sprinter of my middle school, where now I place top 10 ever (which is not hard to do).

1. Kentrell Johnson
2. Evan Ragan
3. Benjamin Bowman
4. Will SHarpsteen
5. Travien Njoroge
6. Levee Mbugua
7. Bryce Closser
8. Trae Oetting
9. Shane Cummings
10. **_Payton Marlin_**

Looking back, sprinting was more fun but the cross country years in high school is what built me to become the person that I am.

### High School Cross Country

In high school, I was expecting to do cross country for conditioning to be able to become the best sprinter in the city.
However in my first day of practice, my coach had other plans for me.
>#### "You are doing long distance, not sprints." 

So the first couple weeks in my freshman [cross country season](https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/Athlete.aspx?AID=9029596) was *hell*. But this is when I found out that the racing wasn't the most important aspect; the most important aspect was the team and the bonding. ![alt text](https://bit.ly/34yqkaD)

Even though I wasn't the best runner on the team during my four years, I still learned a plethora during my time on the team.

### High School Track

After cross country season ended, I did not know what the expect for [track](https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=9029596) during my time in high school. I quickly came to my senses and knew that track was *my* sport to succeed in. I loved the joy and adrenaline from track better than the ones from cross country. ![Track and Friends](https://bit.ly/2OwuIBq)

The team atmosphere was quite a bit different regarding track than that of cross country. The team was bigger, which meant less bonding but also meant more cheering from the team. My favorite races came from track.

### College Running

Now, since I am a full time student committing to courses in Information Technology and Computer Science, all problems can be communicated by code, even running.

```Java
 if (finishingplace == 1) {
          console.log(Gold medal);
        } else if (finishingplalce =/= 1) {
          console.log(try again);
        } else if (no finish) {
          console.log(get amblance);
          } 
        }
      }
```

College races are extremely fun. With [Mizzou Club Running](https://mizzourunningclub.wixsite.com/home) I get to do some races that are comepetitive and races that are more 'fun'. ![Running](https://tinyurl.com/ulxx4al)
