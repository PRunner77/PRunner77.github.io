# Friendships/Networking

Although my college career is focused mainly on schooling, I also want to include a page of my personal development with the people around me. I believe that in college, another part to focus on is your *relationship* growth.

**Why would I include this part in my personal website?**

Take it from **Muhammad Ali**, if you will not listen to me maybe you will listen to him.

>#### “*Friendship* is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It’s not something you learn in school. But if you haven’t learned the meaning of *friendship*, you really haven’t learned anything.”

Although my parents are divorced, I still keep in contact with both of them. I hear many stories of how kids have been separated from their parents, and I am very fortunate to have both of mine with me thoughout college.

It is easier to make a chart of my closest family members, so here they are:

| Relation | Name | Occupation | Traits |
| --- | ---| ---| --- |
| Mother | Christin | Masters-Anesthesiology | Hard-Working, dog-lover |
| Father | Jeff | Self-Employed (own company) | Family-first, lover 
| Step-Father | Patrick | Lawyer-Litigation | Sarcastic, Nerd |
| Step-Mother | Caroline | Body care | Family-First, loving |
| Step-Sister (older) | Lydia | Junior-HS | Nerd, artist |
| Step-Sister (younger) | Octavia | Freshman-HS | Animals, Clean |

I love my family and even though some of my grades have been severely slacking, I am glad they have not disowned me yet; they have all picked me up and told me to keep going when I could not have.

## The Colt (my other family)

Arriving at the Engineering Camp after the first full week of school, I had no friends and was worried. The last night of the camp, a group of weirdos got together and played [spicy uno](https://fun-squared.com/how-to-play-spicy-uno/) and a game of [cards against humanity](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cah/CAH_Rules.pdf).

We originally had no plans to name our group until someone came up with the smart idea to name ourselves the **Cult of Engineers (COE)** after the camp named, similarly, COE.

## Networking

I have been to a multitude of workshops and have talked to some people about being a prospective intern. However with my little knowledge on programming and coding, I am at a disadvantage.

However I have gotten to know the majoirty of my **professors**, **workshop speakers**, **advisors**, and a number of **Career fair employers**.

I will be ready next year or even semester to secure an internship. Going from one of my first coding projects:

```Python
print('Payton Marlin')
print('-Payton likes to run, run, run. His favorite race is the 800M')
print('-He also likes to volunteer. He volunteers at the DeafLEAD Hotline Center')
print('-While he likes to run and volunteer, Payton LOVES going to Football games and hanging out with his friends')
print('-In school, Payton is going to major in either electrical or computer engineering')
print('-He is very excited to start programming and learning more about computers')
```

To something as advanced as this webpage, I am growing my networking opportunites and will be ready in the comming months to show what I know.
