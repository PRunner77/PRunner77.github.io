## [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* Even though Markdown is the most simplistic of the code out there in the world, I did have to use a cheatsheet to remind me of how stuff works.

## [Tiny URL](https://tinyurl.com/) + [Bitly](https://bitly.com/)

* I hate long URL links, especially when I am trying to read and debug my code. So I found that these websites were the best.

  * Although Bitly did want me to sign in to use their service after a certain number or shorteners.


## [Quotes](https://www.positivityblog.com/)

* I hope you did not think I could remember all of these quotes by myself. If I did, I would even suprise myself.
