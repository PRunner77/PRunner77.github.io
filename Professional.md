# Professional Development

Coming in as a first-year at a university seems ~~daunting~~ **horrifying**, especially when you have advisors that want you to secure an internship or job in your specific career path. 

Taking part of college with no expereince with Information Technology or Coding, I ask questions such as how to get ahead of the game. I met a first-year engineering student at one of the workshops hosted by the [Mizzou Engineering Department](https://engineering.missouri.edu/) who stated that he had:

* 96 Credit Hours
* Having two major paths
* Taking the CS 4070 course

Meeting him made me feel extremely behind, yet *amazed* on how someone can be so

## What I Have Done

Even though I may not have any previous experience with coding like the student above, I can promise employers that I will keep on coming back year after year with more experience. 

**What can I show them now?**

* IT 1000 Projects
* Workshops I attended
* Fall Career Fair
* Initiative to keep coming back

Projects in **IT 1000** will not get me a job, but will provide the basis of coding languages such as Python, Java, and C. My *Turtle graphics* image is one of my favorite pieces, but is a lengthy code that could have been shortened.
 
 ```Python
 import turtle



ANIMATION_SPEED=8


turtle.speed(ANIMATION_SPEED)
turtle.bgcolor("black")
turtle.color("red")

turtle.begin_fill()
turtle.forward(30)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(30)
turtle.left(130)
turtle.forward(60)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(70)
turtle.left(140)
turtle.forward(30)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(60)          #First part of arrow in middle

turtle.right(110)
turtle.forward(150)

turtle.right(155)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(38)
turtle.forward(80)
turtle.left(142)
turtle.forward(280)         #inside of the A

turtle.left(85)
turtle.forward(70)
turtle.left(75)
turtle.forward(450)
turtle.left(105)
turtle.forward(70)
turtle.left(80)
turtle.forward(143)
turtle.right(80)
turtle.forward(60)
turtle.end_fill()       #last part of the A, connecting to arrow

turtle.begin_fill()     #begins fill of bottom part of A
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(30)
turtle.penup()
turtle.forward(10)
turtle.pendown()
turtle.forward(25)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(60)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(65)
turtle.left(125)
turtle.forward(75)
turtle.end_fill()           #ends fill
turtle.backward(75)
turtle.right(125)
turtle.backward(65)      #Bottom part of A

turtle.penup()
turtle.backward(50)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(180)
turtle.pendown()
turtle.circle(200)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.penup()
turtle.forward(30)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.pendown()
turtle.circle(230)
```

**This** project definitely will not impress employers but in the future I can show how this was my first project and can show them more advanced projects in the future.
