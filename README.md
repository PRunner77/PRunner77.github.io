My name is [Payton Marlin](https://spark.adobe.com/page/bx0sCvLqR5RHU/), a current first-year student at the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/). Some of my most favorite activities to do include:

    - Running
    - Playing Game
    - Hanging with Friends
    - Studying?
    - Learning to code
    - Many more... (included in other webpages)

Although I do not have ~~**_any_**~~ ~~**_none_**~~ **_nada_** programming experience, I have always wanted to learn how to code and to solve problems. I am taking the dreaded *CS 1050* class next semester, which I have heard is very difficult. However, one quote still stays in my head...
>##  "If you can't fly, then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward." *-Martin Luther King, Jr.*

I have struggled with many of my classes this semester, and this quote from [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1964/king/biographical/) pushed and will push me throughout my college career. In this class, I am proud of where I have come since the beginning of the semester.

### The Turtle Python Project
```Python
ORIGINAL_POSITION=float(input("Enter the scary object's starting position: "))   #Variable for initial position
ORIGINAL_VELOCITY=float(input("Enter the scary object's starting velocity: "))   #Variable for initial velocity
TIME_ELAPSED=float(input("Enter the time that has elasped: "))                   #Variable for time
ACCELERATION=float(input("Enter the acceleration of the scary object: "))        #Variable for acceleration


#Now we just use the equation for final position, using the variables defined
FINAL_POSITION=ORIGINAL_POSITION + ORIGINAL_VELOCITY*TIME_ELAPSED + 0.5*ACCELERATION*TIME_ELAPSED**2
print("\nThe final position of the object is", FINAL_POSITION)  #Finally, we print our function to the screen
```

This block of code above introduced me not only to the simplicity of coding using Python, but of float integers as well. This brought up my enthusiasm of coding.
